IQ Execution Steps

1. Verify Input File
Navigate to the Input folder and ensure that the required Report file is present.


2. Configure Input File Path
Open the Config file and set the value for INPUT.FILE to point to the correct report file.


3. Validate Parent Types
Check the TYPES entry in the Config.

Confirm that all required parent types are listed.

Make sure they are comma-separated.



4. Validate Excluded Child Types
Check the EXCLUDE.TYPE entry.

Ensure all child types that need to be filtered are listed.

These should also be comma-separated.



5. Run the Script
Go to the Script folder and execute the shell script.

The script runs two TCL files in sequence:

First TCL: Reads the Report file and generates type-wise output files in the Output folder based on the configured parent types and excluded child types.

Second TCL: Processes each generated output file and connects each entry to the corresponding Legacy Reference Type object, setting the required attributes on the parent specification.
